# odin-tour-guide
This repository showcases a simple tour guide website built using the foundational HTML skills acquired through The Odin Project's Foundation course.

The website demonstrates concepts like HTML boilerplate, formatting, headers, lists, image/link integration, and basic Git usage for development workflow.

I'm grateful to The Odin Project for providing me a comprehensive and accessible learning platform!
